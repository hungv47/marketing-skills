# IMC Plan — Orchestrator

*Communication — Step 2 of 4. Coordinates specialized agents to turn ICP research into an integrated marketing communication strategy.*

**Core Question:** "Does every angle trace to a pillar, every channel to a habitat, and every timeline slot to a real team capacity?"

## Critical Gates — Read First

- **Identify the growth motion BEFORE selecting channels.** PLG (product drives acquisition), SLG (outbound/performance drives acquisition), or Hybrid. The motion determines channel priorities — PLG favors community/SEO/forums, SLG favors paid/email/IRL/SMS.
- **Evaluate ALL 9 channels, not just digital.** The full channel map: Search engines/AEO, Store/Listing platforms, Bounty/Info platforms, News, Forums/Communities, Social media, IRL (OOH/Events/POS), Mailbox, SMS. Offline channels (IRL, SMS) produce strategy docs and creative briefs for physical execution.
- **Do NOT generate angles before pillars.** Angles are derived PER PILLAR. Without pillars, angles are untethered and fail the anti-generic test.
- **Do NOT assign channels without habitat data.** Channel selection comes from ICP research habitat maps, not marketer preference. No habitat data → interview for it.
- **Do NOT schedule 10 pieces/week for a 2-person team.** Match cadence to actual capacity. Over-scheduling guarantees missed deadlines.
- **Stale ICP research (>30 days) produces misaligned plans.** Recommend re-running `icp-research` before proceeding.

## Philosophy

Frameworks (ORB, 3D Angles, Pillar Types) are proven defaults — not mandatory templates. Adapt based on data. When ICP research provides habitat maps, use them. When it doesn't, gather the data before planning channels.

## Inputs Required
- ICP research from `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md` + `.agents/product-context.md` (or user-provided)

## Output
- `.agents/mkt/imc-plan.md`

## Quality Gate
Before delivering, the **critic agent** verifies:
- [ ] Growth motion explicitly stated (PLG / SLG / Hybrid)
- [ ] 3-5 pillars, each with ICP evidence
- [ ] 3+ angles per pillar, each passing 3Q test and scored ≥15/25
- [ ] All 9 channels evaluated (selected or explicitly skipped with rationale)
- [ ] Each selected channel has ONE specific angle (not a content category)
- [ ] Channel selection based on ICP habitat data AND growth motion alignment
- [ ] Channel execution briefs present for every selected channel
- [ ] Offline channels (if selected) include compliance and execution notes
- [ ] Timeline has 3 phases with realistic cadence
- [ ] Launch sequence follows ORB (Owned → Rented → Borrowed)

## Chain Position
Previous: `icp-research` | Next: `content-create`
**Re-run triggers:** When ICP research is updated, when launching a new product/campaign, or when attribution reveals underperforming channels.

### Skill Deference
- **Need actual content written?** → Use `content-create` — this skill plans, not writes.
- **Need numeric targets (CAC, LTV, conversion rates)?** → Use `funnel-planner`.
- **Need to compare pages for SEO?** → Coordinate with `seo` for keyword targeting and content structure.
- **Need to attribute results to initiatives?** → Use `attribution` after execution.

## Agent Manifest

| Agent | Layer | File | Focus |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| Pillar Agent | 1 | `agents/pillar-agent.md` | 3-5 messaging pillars from ICP pains |
| Angle Agent | 2 (sequential) | `agents/angle-agent.md` | 3D angle generation per pillar |
| Channel Agent | 2 (sequential) | `agents/channel-agent.md` | 9-channel evaluation with habitat-informed selection + execution briefs |
| Timeline Agent | 2 (sequential) | `agents/timeline-agent.md` | Phase sequencing + editorial calendar |
| Launch Sequencing Agent | 2 (sequential) | `agents/launch-sequencing-agent.md` | ORB Framework channel activation order |
| Critic Agent | 2 (final) | `agents/critic-agent.md` | Alignment, scoring rigor, completeness |

### Shared References (read by agents)
- `references/3d-angle-framework.md` — Three-dimensional angle generation methodology (used by angle-agent)
- `references/channel-strategy.md` — Habitat-informed channel selection framework (used by channel-agent)
- `references/examples.md` — Complete worked examples across 5 business types

**Note:** This skill is primarily sequential — each agent depends on the previous. Pillar-agent is the only Layer 1 agent. The value of multi-agent here is in specialist focus, critic gate, and single-agent fallback — not parallelism.

---

## Routing Logic

### Route A: Quick Plan (MVP or Startup)
**When:** Limited ICP data, small team, need a plan fast.

```
1. Pre-dispatch: Gather context (Step 0)
2. Dispatch: pillar-agent (3 pillars, not 5)
3. Dispatch: angle-agent (2 angles per pillar, not 3+)
4. Dispatch: channel-agent (top 2-3 channels only)
5. Dispatch: critic-agent
6. If FAIL → re-dispatch (max 2 cycles)
7. Deliver — timeline and launch sequence done by orchestrator inline
```

### Route B: Full Plan
**When:** ICP research complete, campaign launch, or strategic planning.

```
1. Pre-dispatch: Gather context (Step 0)
2. LAYER 1: Dispatch pillar-agent
3. LAYER 2 — Dispatch SEQUENTIALLY:
   - angle-agent (receives pillar output)
   - channel-agent (receives angle output + habitat data)
   - timeline-agent (receives channel output)
   - launch-sequencing-agent (receives timeline output)
4. Dispatch: critic-agent (receives complete plan)
5. If FAIL → re-dispatch named agent(s) with feedback (max 2 cycles)
6. Deliver artifact
```

### Route C: Called by Another Skill
**When:** `content-create` or `attribution` needs plan context.

```
1. Read existing .agents/mkt/imc-plan.md if available
2. If not available, run Route B
3. Return plan to calling skill
```

---

## Step 0: Pre-Dispatch Context Gathering

### Product Context Check
Check for `.agents/product-context.md` and `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md`. If `date` fields are older than 30 days, **warn the user** and recommend re-running `icp-research`.

### Required Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | If Missing |
|----------|--------|------------|
| `icp-research.md` | icp-research | **INTERVIEW.** Gather: audience, pains, habitats, awareness stage. |

### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `product-context.md` | icp-research | Product details, voice adjectives |
| `solution-design.md` | solution-design | Strategic initiatives for alignment |

### Growth Motion Identification

Before dispatching any agent, determine the growth motion:

| Signal | Motion | Channel Priority |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Free tier/trial exists, self-serve signup, product virality | **PLG** | Search engines/AEO, Forums/Communities, Social media (organic), Mailbox (onboarding), Store/Listing platforms, Bounty/Info platforms |
| Sales team, high ACV, demos required, paid channels primary | **SLG** | Search engines/AEO (paid), Social media (paid), Mailbox (outbound), SMS, IRL (events/OOH), News |
| Both motions coexist (e.g., self-serve SMB + sales enterprise) | **Hybrid** | Blend both — designate primary motion per audience segment |

If growth motion is unclear from upstream artifacts, ask: "Does your product grow through self-serve adoption (PLG), outbound/paid performance (SLG), or both?"

### Context to Pass to All Agents
1. **Growth motion:** PLG, SLG, or Hybrid (determines channel weighting)
2. **Campaign goal:** what success looks like
3. **ICP summary:** persona, pains, habitats, awareness levels
4. **VoC quotes:** top buyer-language phrases
5. **Constraints:** team size, budget, timeline

---

## Dispatch Protocol

### How to spawn a sub-agent

1. **Read** the agent instruction file — include its FULL content in the Agent prompt
2. **Append** the context and upstream output after the instructions
3. **Resolve file paths to absolute**: replace relative paths with absolute paths
4. **Pass upstream artifacts by content**: orchestrator reads `.agents/` files, includes relevant excerpts
5. If **feedback** exists, append with "## Critic Feedback — Address Every Point"

### Single-agent fallback

If multi-agent dispatch is unavailable, execute sequentially in-context:
1. Pillar extraction (3-5 from ICP)
2. Angle generation per pillar (3D framework)
3. Channel assignment per angle (habitat-informed)
4. Timeline phasing (Pre-launch → Launch → Sustain)
5. Launch sequencing (ORB)
6. Self-evaluate with critic rubric

---

## Orchestrator-Written Sections

The orchestrator writes these sections inline (no agent dispatched):
- **Growth Motion** — determined in Step 0, written directly into the artifact before Layer 1
- **Foundation** — core message and awareness distribution, assembled after pillar-agent returns
- **Channel Execution Briefs** — assembled by the orchestrator after channel-agent returns, using channel-agent's output (channel assignments + habitat data) to populate the briefs table with objective, tactic, budget type, metric, owner, and milestone per channel

## Layer 1: Pillar Foundation

Dispatch **pillar-agent** alone. It produces the pillar table that all downstream agents need.

| Agent | Instruction File | Pass These Inputs | Reference Files |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Pillar Agent | `agents/pillar-agent.md` | brief + ICP research summary + VoC | — |

Wait for completion. Pillar output becomes input for all Layer 2 agents.

---

## Layer 2: Sequential Strategy Chain

Dispatch **ONE AT A TIME, IN ORDER**. Each receives the previous agent's output.

```
pillar-agent → angle-agent → channel-agent → timeline-agent → launch-sequencing-agent → critic-agent
```

| Step | Agent | Instruction File | Receives | Reference Files |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Angle Agent | `agents/angle-agent.md` | Pillar table | `references/3d-angle-framework.md` |
| 2 | Channel Agent | `agents/channel-agent.md` | Angle bank + habitat data + growth motion | `references/channel-strategy.md` (includes 9-Channel Framework) |
| 3 | Timeline Agent | `agents/timeline-agent.md` | Channel assignments | — |
| 4 | Launch Sequencing Agent | `agents/launch-sequencing-agent.md` | Timeline | — |
| 5 | Critic Agent | `agents/critic-agent.md` | Complete assembled plan | — |

---

## Critic Gate

- **PASS:** Deliver the plan artifact.
- **FAIL:** Re-dispatch the earliest failing agent with critic feedback. Max 2 cycles.

**Skill:** imc-plan
**Goal:** [campaign objective]
**Audience:** [primary persona]

## Growth Motion
- **Motion:** [PLG / SLG / Hybrid]
- **Primary acquisition lever:** [product / outbound / both]
- **Channel weighting rationale:** [why these channels match the motion]

## Foundation
- **Core message:** [one sentence]
- **Awareness distribution:** [% per stage]

## Pillars
| # | Pillar | Type | % | Stage | Evidence |

## Channel Assignments
| Channel | Type | Angle | Role | Cadence |
|---------|------|-------|------|---------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**9-Channel Evaluation:** For each channel, the channel-agent assesses relevance and produces a select/skip decision. Channels: Search engines/AEO, Store/Listing platforms, Bounty/Info platforms, News, Forums/Communities, Social media, IRL (OOH/Events/POS), Mailbox, SMS.

## Channel Execution Briefs

For each selected channel, a mini-brief with actionable next steps:

| Channel | Objective | Tactic | Budget Type | Success Metric | Owner | First Milestone |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|-----------------|
| [e.g. Search engines] | [e.g. Capture intent traffic] | [e.g. Google Search ads + SEO content] | [Paid + Organic] | [CTR, CPL] | [Person] | [e.g. First campaign live by W2] |

For offline channels (IRL, SMS), include execution notes:
- **IRL:** Vendor/location requirements, lead capture method (QR code, signup form), follow-up workflow
- **SMS:** Compliance requirements (TCPA/GDPR opt-in), character limits (160 GSM-7), unsubscribe mechanism
- **OOH:** Readability specs, vanity URL/QR for tracking, legal disclaimers

## Timeline
| Week | Phase | Channel | Angle | Format | Status |
|------|-------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| W1 | ... | ... | ... | ... | Planned |

## Launch Sequence
| Phase | Timing | Channels | Action |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| Internal | T-4w | ... | ... |

> On re-run: rename existing artifact to `imc-plan.v[N].md` and create new with incremented version.

## Next Step

Run `content-research` to research what content is working in the market. Run `content-create` to produce the content assets from this plan. Run `attribution` to set up measurement.
```

## Worked Example — B2B SaaS Project Management Tool (Route B)

### Step 0: Pre-Dispatch
Goal: Drive 500 trial signups in 60 days. Audience: Engineering managers at 50-200 person companies. Awareness: 60% Problem Aware, 30% Solution Aware, 10% Product Aware.

### Layer 1: Pillar Agent
Returns 4 pillars:
| # | Pillar | Type | % | Stage |
|---|--------|------|---|-------|
| 1 | "The meeting tax" | Problem | 35% | Problem Aware |
| 2 | "Async-first shipping" | Transformation | 30% | Solution Aware |
| 3 | "Teams who switched" | Trust | 25% | Product Aware |
| 4 | "The async-first movement" | Social | 10% | All |

### Layer 2, Step 1: Angle Agent
Returns 12 angles across 4 pillars, scored 15-23/25. Example angles:
- "12 hrs/week lost to status theater" (Data, Problem Aware, Fear, 22/25, Shareable)
- "How to ship 2x without hiring" (How-to, Solution Aware, Greed, 20/25, Searchable)

### Layer 2, Step 2: Channel Agent
Returns assignments: LinkedIn (primary, "12 hrs/week"), Email (owned, "async-first shipping"), X/Twitter (ecosystem, "teams who switched"), Blog (owned, searchable how-to content).

### Layer 2, Step 3: Timeline Agent
Returns 3 phases: Pre-launch (W1-W3, problem content), Launch (W4-W5, transformation + proof), Sustain (W6+, trust + social). Weekly calendar with pillar rotation.

### Layer 2, Step 4: Launch Sequencing Agent
Returns ORB sequence: Internal (T-4w) → Email list alpha (T-2w) → Partner posts (T-1w) → LinkedIn/X launch (Day 0) → PR + paid (T+1w).

### Critic Agent → PASS
All quality gates met. Pillar-angle-channel traces verified. Timeline realistic for 3-person team.

## Anti-Patterns

**Channel-first planning** — "We need TikTok content." INSTEAD: Start with habitat maps. If ICP density on TikTok is Low, deprioritize it regardless of what's trendy.

**Identical messages across channels** — Same text on LinkedIn, X, and Email. INSTEAD: Each channel gets one specific angle adapted to its native format.

**Angles without pillar connection** — Orphan angles that don't trace back. INSTEAD: Every angle names its parent pillar. No exceptions.

**Timeline without capacity check** — 10 pieces/week for a solo marketer. INSTEAD: Match cadence to team size. 3 pieces/week is realistic for one person.

**Too many pillars** — 7 pillars dilute the message. INSTEAD: 3-5. If you can't cut, you haven't committed to a strategy.
