description: "This skill should be invoked when the user wants a marketing strategy, campaign plan, or channel strategy. Triggers include 'how do I market this', 'I have a product but no go-to-market plan', 'we have no marketing plan', 'nobody knows about us', 'how do I get the word out', 'how do I promote this', planning a marketing launch, GTM strategy, choosing channels, 'which channels should I use', 'should I be on TikTok or LinkedIn', 'how should we position this', content strategy, content calendar, or 'get my first users' -- even if they just say 'where should we spend our marketing budget' or 'we post a lot but nothing works.' Not for writing actual content (use content-create), setting numeric targets (use funnel-planner), strategic prioritization across non-marketing levers (use solution-design), diagnosing why a launched product has no traction (use problem-analysis first), or organic search strategy (use seo)."

# Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC)

*Communicate Track — Step 2 of 4. Turns audience insights into pillars, tested angles, channel assignments, and a phased timeline.*

**Core Question:** "How do all these channels work together?"

## Philosophy

Frameworks, percentages, and templates here are strong defaults — not rigid rules. When audience data, business context, or creative instinct suggests a different approach, adapt freely. Document reasoning so the team learns from deviations.

## Inputs Required
- ICP research from `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md`

## Output
- `.agents/mkt/imc-plan.md`

## Quality Gate
Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Every pillar traces to a specific pain or aspiration from ICP research (with a quotable VoC source)
- [ ] Every angle passes ALL three questions: visual? falsifiable? uniquely yours?
- [ ] Every channel assignment cites the habitat map (not guessed)
- [ ] Timeline has specific dates, not just "Phase 1"

## Chain Position
Previous: `icp-research` | Next: `content-create`
**Re-run triggers:** When ICP research is updated, after major product launches, when entering new channels, or quarterly.

### Coordination with SEO
If angles include competitor comparisons, coordinate with `seo` for technical SEO optimization of comparison pages. IMC owns angle selection and prioritization; SEO owns page structure, schema markup, and keyword targeting.

---

## Before Starting

### Step 0: Product Context
Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If available, read for product positioning context.
If `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md`'s `date` field is older than 30 days, recommend re-running `icp-research` before proceeding — stale audience data produces misaligned communication plans.

### Required Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | If Missing |
|----------|--------|------------|
| `icp-research.md` | icp-research | **STOP.** "Run icp-research first — guessed audiences produce weak IMC plans." |

### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `product-context.md` | icp-research | Product positioning context |
| `solution-design.md` | solution-design (from hungv47/strategy-skills) | Aligns content pillars with solution priorities |

Read `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md`. Import personas, pains, habitat maps, VoC quotes.

---

## Step 1: Foundation

**Goals:** Define the objective. (Awareness / Leads / Sales / Retention) Timeline? Situation? (Launch / Ongoing / Seasonal)

**Core Message:** If the audience remembers one thing, what is it?

**Awareness Levels:** Where is the audience now?

| Stage | They think... | Your job |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Unaware | "No problem" | Surface it |
| Problem Aware | "Problem, no fix" | Demonstrate understanding |
| Solution Aware | "Fixes exist, which?" | Differentiate |
| Product Aware | "I know this, not sure" | Overcome objections |
| Most Aware | "Ready" | Clear CTA |

---

## Step 2: Pillars (from ICP pains)

Extract 3-5 pillars from ICP research:

| Source | Pillar Type | % Content (default) |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Top Pain Points | Problem | 25-30% |
| Aspirational Identity | Transformation | 30-35% |
| Current Workarounds | Alternative | 20-25% |
| Decision Criteria | Trust | 15-20% |

Adjust based on audience awareness level — an Unaware market may need 50%+ Problem content. Let ICP data drive the split, not this table.

Trace each pillar to a VoC quote or ICP finding — pillars without audience evidence produce content that sounds generic.

---

## Step 3: Angles (3 per pillar, tested)

For each pillar, generate 3 angles combining: hook type + awareness stage + emotional trigger.

### The 3-Question Test

Every angle must pass ALL three:

1. **Visual?** Picture it — does an image form? ("12 hours lost to status updates" = yes. "Improve productivity" = no.)
2. **Falsifiable?** Can it be proven true or false? ("31 hrs/month in unproductive meetings" = yes. "We help teams succeed" = no.)
3. **Uniquely yours?** Could a competitor use this? ("The dating app designed to be deleted" = only Hinge. "The best project tool" = anyone.)

3 yeses → keep. Any no → rewrite or cut — angles that fail even one question underperform in production.

Also screen for AI copy slop — if the angle reads like generic SaaS marketing ("Unlock the power of...", "Revolutionize your...", "In today's fast-paced world..."), it fails Uniquely Yours regardless of the product name. Slop enters the pipeline here; catching it prevents wasted production effort in `content-create`.

See [references/3d-angle-framework.md](references/3d-angle-framework.md) for hook types and generation framework.

### Angle Prioritization (when angles exceed capacity)

When multiple angles pass the 3-Question Test, score them to decide production order:

| Factor | Weight | Score 1-5 |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Audience Pain Intensity | 40% | How acute is the pain this angle targets? (scored using ICP evidence — see below) |
| 3-Question Score | 30% | How strongly does it pass visual + falsifiable + unique? |
| Channel-Content Fit | 20% | How well does the angle suit available channels? |
| Production Effort | 10% | How easy to produce? (lower effort = higher score) |

**Weighted score** = (Pain × 0.4) + (3Q × 0.3) + (Fit × 0.2) + (Effort × 0.1)

Starting defaults. If resource-constrained, increase Production Effort weight. If you have few angles, skip scoring and produce them all. The formula prevents common mistakes at scale — it's not required for a 3-angle plan.

Produce highest-scoring angles first. This prevents the common trap of producing easy content that doesn't address the sharpest audience pains.

**How to score Pain Intensity (the 40% factor):**

| Score | Evidence Required |
|-------|------------------|
| 5 | Pain blocks purchase decisions (cited as top objection in ICP decision psychology) |
| 4 | Pain has financial or career impact (specific cost/consequence cited in VoC) |
| 3 | Pain causes regular time waste (mentioned in 3+ VoC quotes) |
| 2 | Pain is acknowledged but low priority ("nice to fix" language in VoC) |
| 1 | Pain is assumed, no VoC evidence supports it |

Cross-reference against ICP research: count distinct quotes mentioning this pain, check if it appears in decision psychology objections, and check emotional intensity. A pain that blocks purchase (score 5) deserves 40% weight; an assumed pain (score 1) doesn't deserve production resources.

### Content Classification

Tag each surviving angle as **Searchable** (captures existing demand via keywords), **Shareable** (creates demand via novelty/emotion), or **Both**. See [references/channel-strategy.md](references/channel-strategy.md) for classification details and channel routing rules.

---

## Step 4: Channels (from habitat map)

Pull channel assignments from the persona habitat maps in ICP research — guessing channels wastes budget on platforms where the audience isn't active.

Assign one clear angle per channel:

| Platform | Specific Channel | Angle | Why (habitat evidence) |
|----------|-----------------|-------|----------------------|
| [Platform] | [Specific group/account] | "[Angle text]" | [Density + engagement from ICP] |

See [references/channel-strategy.md](references/channel-strategy.md) for channel hierarchy.

---

## Step 5: Phase Timeline

| Phase | Dates | Focus | Content Mix (typical) |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Pre-launch | [start–end] | Build anticipation, educate on problem | 70% Problem, 30% Solution |
| Launch | [start–end] | Drive action, prove value | 30% Problem, 40% Proof, 30% CTA |
| Sustain | [start–ongoing] | Maintain presence, deepen trust | 40% Solution, 30% Proof, 30% Brand |

Depends on existing assets and audience awareness. A product with strong proof can front-load Proof in pre-launch. A category-creating product may need 90% Problem throughout.

## Anti-Patterns

**Channel-first planning** — Choosing channels before defining pillars and angles produces content that fits the platform but misses the audience. Always start from ICP pains → pillars → angles → then assign channels.

**Identical message across channels** — Copy-pasting the same angle to every platform wastes the channel's native strengths. Each channel assignment should use an angle suited to that platform's engagement type.

**No pillar-to-audience connection** — Pillars that sound strategic but can't trace back to a specific VoC quote or ICP finding. Untethered pillars produce content that sounds generic and underperforms.

**Timeline without dependencies** — Listing phases without specifying what must complete before the next phase begins. Pre-launch content must exist before launch — if it doesn't, the timeline is fiction.

**Too many pillars** — More than 5 pillars dilutes content quality and makes the editorial calendar unmanageable. Force-rank by audience pain intensity and cut to 3-5.

---

## Launch Sequencing (ORB Framework)

When the IMC plan is for a product launch (not ongoing campaign), use phased rollout instead of a single "launch day":

### Channel Priority: Owned → Rented → Borrowed

| Channel Type | Examples | Role | When |
|-------------|---------|------|------|
| **Owned** | Email list, blog, community | Build anticipation with people you control | Pre-launch through sustain |
| **Rented** | Social media, marketplaces, paid ads | Amplify to borrowed audiences | Launch through sustain |
| **Borrowed** | Guest posts, influencer partnerships, PR | Credibility + reach from others' audiences | Launch peak |

Everything should funnel back to owned channels. Rented and borrowed channels build your owned audience — they're not ends in themselves.

### Five-Phase Launch

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Action |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Internal** | 1-2 weeks | Align team, prepare assets | Ensure everyone can demo and explain |
| **Alpha** | 1-2 weeks | Trusted users/advisors | Get candid feedback, fix breaking issues |
| **Beta** | 2-4 weeks | Wider trusted group | Collect testimonials, refine messaging |
| **Early Access** | 1-2 weeks | Waitlist, community | Build anticipation, create FOMO with limited access |
| **Full Launch** | Launch day + 2 weeks | Public | Coordinate all channels simultaneously |

**Key insight:** A launch is a campaign, not a day. Stagger announcements across phases to maintain momentum — shipping everything at once means one spike and silence.

---

## Editorial Calendar Guidance

After the IMC plan is created, content needs a production cadence — not just a one-time angle bank.

### Weekly Content Mix

Allocate content production across pillars and types:

| Content Type | % of Weekly Output (default) | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Pillar content (long-form) | 20% | SEO, authority, depth |
| Angle-driven social | 50% | Engagement, reach, community |
| Trust/proof content | 20% | Case studies, testimonials, data |
| Brand/culture | 10% | Personality, team, values |

Starting allocation. Adjust based on what's working — re-evaluate quarterly based on attribution data.

### Batch Production

Produce content in batches, not one piece at a time:
1. **Weekly batch:** Generate 5-7 social pieces from 1-2 angles
2. **Bi-weekly batch:** Produce 1 long-form piece (blog, guide, video)
3. **Monthly batch:** Create 1 proof piece (case study, data report)

### Pillar Rotation

Rotate through pillars to prevent audience fatigue:
- Don't post the same pillar more than 2 days in a row
- Each pillar should appear at least once per week
- Track which pillars drive the most engagement — adjust % allocation quarterly
