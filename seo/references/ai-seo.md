## Platform-Specific Optimization

### Google AI Overviews

**Data source:** Traditional Google Search index + structured data + Knowledge Graph

**What gets cited:**
- Content already ranking well in traditional search
- Pages with FAQ and How-To schema markup
- Content with strong E-E-A-T signals
- Featured snippet content (often pulled directly into AI Overviews)

**Priority actions:**
1. Implement structured data (FAQ, How-To, Article schema)
2. Optimize for featured snippets (direct answers at top of content)
3. Maintain strong traditional SEO fundamentals
4. Complete Google Business Profile
5. Build entity associations in Knowledge Graph

**Note:** Google AI Overviews appear in ~45% of searches and can reduce clicks by up to 58%. Being cited in the AI Overview is increasingly important for maintaining traffic.

### ChatGPT (with browsing)

**Data source:** Bing index + GPTBot crawl + training data

**What gets cited:**
- Third-party reviews and mentions (heavily weighted)
- Original research and proprietary data
- Well-structured comparison content
- Content from high-authority domains

**Priority actions:**
1. Allow GPTBot in robots.txt
2. Build third-party mentions (review sites, industry publications)
3. Publish original data that can't be found elsewhere
4. Ensure consistent entity information across the web

**Key insight:** ChatGPT heavily weights third-party sources. Your G2 profile may matter more than your own website for ChatGPT citations.

### Perplexity

**Data source:** PerplexityBot (own crawler) + Bing + multiple search APIs

**What gets cited:**
- Content with inline source citations (Perplexity loves content that itself cites sources)
- Structured comparison tables
- Direct answer passages (40-60 words)
- Recent content (aggressive freshness preference)

**Priority actions:**
1. Allow PerplexityBot in robots.txt
2. Cite sources within your content
3. Use comparison tables extensively
4. Write clear 40-60 word answer blocks under H2 headings
5. Keep content fresh — update dates and data regularly

**Key insight:** Perplexity always shows its sources. Getting cited creates a visible, clickable attribution.

### Claude

**Data source:** Training data + ClaudeBot crawl

**What gets cited:**
- Expert-attributed content with clear credentials
- Nuanced, balanced analysis (not marketing fluff)
- Content that acknowledges tradeoffs and limitations
- Original research and data

**Priority actions:**
1. Allow ClaudeBot in robots.txt
2. Publish expert-authored content with clear attribution
3. Create balanced analysis acknowledging limitations
4. Provide original data and unique insights

**Key insight:** Claude prefers balanced, honest content. Acknowledging tradeoffs may perform better than pure sales copy.

### Gemini

**Data source:** Google index + Knowledge Graph + Google Business Profile

**Priority actions:**
1. Optimize Google Business Profile completely
2. Build Knowledge Graph presence
3. Publish on YouTube (Gemini has preferential access)
4. Implement Organization and Product schema
