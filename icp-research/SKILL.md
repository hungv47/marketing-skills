# ICP Research & Audience Intelligence

*Communicate Track — Step 1 of 4. Builds deep audience intelligence from real research, not assumptions.*

**Core Question:** "Who exactly are we talking to and what keeps them up at night?"

## Philosophy

This skill provides research structure, not a rigid formula. The minimums for channels, quotes, and platforms ensure thoroughness — they're not arbitrary thresholds. If overwhelming evidence surfaces in 2 channels, you don't need a third. If one devastating quote captures a pain perfectly, you don't need three. Let evidence dictate depth.

## Inputs Required
- Product context from `.agents/mkt/product-context.md` (or willingness to answer product questions)

## Output
- `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md`

## Quality Gate
Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Every VoC quote includes platform name and is from a real source (not agent-generated)
- [ ] Each persona has a habitat map with specific channels with supporting evidence. Aim for ≥3; if research surfaces fewer, document why (niche audience, concentrated community). (Not just "Reddit" — which subreddit?)
- [ ] Each emotional driver is traced to ≥2 specific quotes
- [ ] Decision psychology section names specific cognitive biases and objections (not generic "they need trust")

## Before Starting

### Step 0: Product Context (Canonical Source)
Check for `.agents/mkt/product-context.md`. If missing, **scan first, then interview for gaps:**

1. **Auto-scan available sources:** Look for README.md, marketing site copy, pricing page, product descriptions, and any existing documentation in the codebase. Extract what you can about the 8 dimensions below.
2. **Interview only for gaps:** Present what you found and ask the user to confirm, correct, or fill in missing dimensions.

This scan-then-interview approach avoids asking the user questions they've already answered elsewhere. This skill is the canonical source for product context across all marketing skills. Save to `.agents/mkt/product-context.md`:

```markdown
# Product Context

**Date:** [today]

## Product
[One sentence: what you sell]

## Buyer
[Primary buyer: role, company type, situation]

## Problem
[The pain it solves — in their words, not yours]

## Differentiator
[What's different — something a competitor CANNOT claim]

## Social Proof
[Best testimonial or most repeated praise]

## Model
[Price, pricing model, free trial availability]

## Voice
[3 adjectives: e.g., "direct, technical, warm"]

## Primary CTA
[What should people do next: e.g., "Start free trial"]
```

All marketing skills read this file for product context.

### Required Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | If Missing |
|----------|--------|------------|
| `product-context.md` | icp-research | **INTERVIEW.** Interview for 8 product dimensions and save to `.agents/mkt/product-context.md`. |

### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `problem-analysis.md` | problem-analysis (from hungv47/strategy-skills) | Problem context sharpens audience research |

---

## Step 1: Scope

Interview for:
1. **Who are we researching?** (Job role, mindset, community, or use case)
2. **What decisions will this inform?** (Messaging? Channels? Positioning? All three?)
3. **B2C or B2B?** Geography? Specific segments to focus or exclude?

---

## Step 2: Research

Use WebSearch — real quotes prevent hallucinated personas and grounded pain points. Avoid generating hypothetical quotes, invented personas, or assumed pain points — they collapse under scrutiny and mislead downstream skills.

### Search Query Patterns

Use these specific queries. Adapt [topic] to the product/audience:

| Goal | Query Pattern |
|------|--------------|
| Find communities | `site:reddit.com "[topic]" subreddit` |
| Find pain points | `site:reddit.com "[topic]" frustrated OR struggling OR hate` |
| Find reviews | `site:g2.com "[product category]" OR site:capterra.com "[product category]"` |
| Find discussions | `"[topic]" forum OR community best OR worst` |
| Find Twitter takes | `site:twitter.com "[topic]" thread` |
| Find decision criteria | `"[product category]" vs OR alternative OR switch from` |
| Find objections | `"[product/competitor]" not worth OR overpriced OR disappointing` |

### Multi-Platform Coverage

Search across multiple categories for breadth. Aim for ≥4 when audience is spread; for niche B2B, 2-3 may suffice if they cover primary habitats:

| Category | Where | What to Extract |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Communities | Reddit, Facebook Groups, LinkedIn Groups | Pain expressions, solution attempts |
| Social | Twitter/X, TikTok | Real-time frustrations, opinions |
| Reviews | G2, Capterra, App Store, Amazon | Feature complaints, switching reasons |
| Content | YouTube comments, Quora | Questions asked, knowledge gaps |
| Professional | Discord, Slack communities, industry forums | Unfiltered opinions, workflow details |

### VoC Quality Criteria

A **good quote** has:
- Emotional intensity (frustration, excitement, relief — not neutral)
- Specificity (mentions a specific tool, workflow, number, or scenario)
- Recency (within last 12 months)
- Relevance to the product category

A **bad quote** is:
- Generic ("I wish there was a better way")
- Old (2+ years, industry may have shifted)
- From a seller/marketer, not a real user
- A one-word reaction with no context

Collect 3 quotes per pain category. Stop when patterns repeat.

**Quote weighting** — not all quotes are equally useful. Prioritize:

| Priority | Quote Type | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| **Critical** | Decision-maker quote (buyer, budget holder) | Their words are what stops or starts a purchase |
| **High** | Quote revealing mechanism (explains WHY pain exists, not just that it does) | Mechanisms inform solutions; complaints only inform messaging |
| **High** | Quote contradicting your assumptions | The most valuable data is what surprises you |
| **Standard** | User/practitioner quote expressing pain | Useful for copy but doesn't reveal buying dynamics |
| **Low** | Emotion-only quote ("this is so frustrating") without mechanism | Validates intensity but gives no strategic direction |

Hunt for mechanism-revealing and decision-maker quotes first — they're the most strategically useful.

When you have 3 quotes for a pain category, check: do you have at least one mechanism-revealing quote? If all 3 are emotion-only, keep searching — you have the WHAT but not the WHY.

### Pain Analysis (3 Levels)

| Level | What | Where to Find |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Surface** | What they openly complain about | Public forums, review sites |
| **Hidden** | What they say anonymously | Reddit throwaways, anonymous reviews |
| **Emotional** | Identity threats, status anxiety, fear | Language intensity, desperation indicators |

### Habitat Mapping

For every platform where audience activity appears, document specifically — vague platform names produce vague channel strategies downstream:

| Platform | Specific Community | Density | Engagement Type | Role |
|----------|-------------------|---------|----------------|------|
| Reddit | r/[specific subreddit] | H/M/L | Lurker/Engager/Creator | Discovery/Trust/Conversion |

Specify the exact community, not just the platform — "Reddit" is too vague; name the subreddit. "LinkedIn" is too vague; name the group or content type.

**Engagement type classification** — sample 20-30 profiles from the community to classify:

| Type | Behavior Threshold | How to Identify |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Lurker** | Visits regularly, posts <1x/month, consumes >10 pieces/week | No visible post history in community; high member count vs. low post volume |
| **Engager** | Comments/likes 1-4x/month, occasionally shares | Visible in comment sections, responds to others, doesn't start threads |
| **Creator** | Posts original content 1x/week+, starts discussions, responds to replies | Active post history, recognized by community, generates threads |
| **Subscriber** | Prefers push content (email, notifications), passive consumption | Follows newsletters, subscribed to feeds, rarely visible in community |
| **Searcher** | Uses platform search when problems arise, no ongoing presence | Appears in search-triggered threads, asks questions then disappears |

Assign **density** as % of your target persona active in the community: H = >30%, M = 10-30%, L = <10%. Estimate by checking: how many posts in the last month are from someone matching your persona's role/situation?

See [references/habitat-mapping.md](references/habitat-mapping.md) for density definitions.

### Decision Psychology

Document:
- **Trigger:** What event makes them seek solutions?
- **Research behavior:** Where they go first, second, third
- **Cognitive biases:** Which are strongest? (Loss aversion? Social proof? Authority?)
- **Top 3 objections:** What stops them from buying? What's the psychological root of each?
- **Trust signals:** Who/what do they trust? What creates instant distrust?

---

## Step 3: Synthesize

### 2 Personas (max) — Genuine constraint: more than 2 dilutes focus for downstream skills. Force-rank if research reveals 4+ segments.

For each persona, provide ALL of:
- **Demographics:** Age range, role, industry, company size
- **Pain Profile:** Top 3 pains with triggers, impact, and quotes
- **Decision Psychology:** Research behavior, biases, objections + roots
- **Habitat Map:** ≥3 specific channels with density and engagement type
- **VoC Quotes:** 3-5 most revealing, with platform attribution

### Top 3 Emotional Drivers
Core psychological motivations. Each traced to ≥2 specific quotes.

### Red Flags
Language or positioning that triggers instant skepticism for this audience.

## Worked Example

**User:** "Research my ICP for a project management tool aimed at engineering teams."

**Interview:**
- "Who are we researching?" → "Engineering managers at mid-size SaaS companies (50-200 engineers)"
- "What decisions will this inform?" → "Messaging and channel strategy for launch"
- "B2B or B2C?" → "B2B, US and EU"

**Artifact saved to `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md`:**

```markdown
# ICP Research

**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Skill:** icp-research
**Product:** ProjectSync — async project visibility for engineering teams

## Persona 1: The Overwhelmed EM

**Demographics:** 30-40, Engineering Manager, B2B SaaS, 50-200 engineers

### Pain Profile
1. **Status update theater** — hours lost writing updates nobody reads
   - Trigger: Monday morning status email that takes 45 min to compile
   - Impact: 6-8 hrs/week across the team on reporting instead of building
   - Quote: "I spend more time telling people what I did than actually doing it" — r/ExperiencedDevs
   - Quote: "Our Monday standup is 45 minutes of people reading Jira tickets aloud" — r/engineeringmanagers

### Habitat Map
| Platform | Community | Density | Engagement | Role |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|------|
| Reddit | r/ExperiencedDevs | H | Engager | Discovery |
| Reddit | r/engineeringmanagers | M | Lurker | Trust |
| LinkedIn | #engineeringmanagement feed | M | Creator | Conversion |
```

## Anti-Patterns

**Demographic-only personas** — "35-year-old male, $80K income" tells marketing nothing about motivations or language. Personas must include pain profile, decision psychology, and habitat map — demographics alone produce generic messaging.

**Hallucinated quotes** — Generating plausible-sounding VoC quotes instead of finding real ones. Fabricated quotes collapse under scrutiny and mislead downstream skills. Every quote must include a real platform attribution.

**Researching existing customers only** — Existing customers survived the funnel; their feedback has survivorship bias. Research must include prospects who *didn't* convert and users of competitor products.

**Too many personas** — More than 2 personas dilutes focus and makes downstream IMC planning impossible. If research reveals 4+ distinct segments, force-rank and pick the top 2 by revenue potential.

**Platform-level habitat mapping** — "They're on LinkedIn" is too vague to act on. Specify the exact subreddit, group, hashtag, or content type — vague platforms produce vague channel strategies.
