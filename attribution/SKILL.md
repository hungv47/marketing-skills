# Attribution Mapping

*Communication — Step 4 of 4. Validates the system — every initiative and content piece connects to a KPI, with action items for every gap.*

**Core Question:** "Can we trace every initiative to a measurable outcome?"

## Inputs Required
- KPIs from `.agents/targets.md` or existing OKRs
- Initiatives from `.agents/solution-design.md`
- Content from `.agents/mkt/imc-plan.md` or `.agents/mkt/content/`

## Output
- `.agents/mkt/attribution.md`

## Quality Gate
Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Every KPI has ≥1 initiative mapped or is explicitly flagged with an action item
- [ ] Every initiative maps to a KPI or has a "Kill" recommendation with reason
- [ ] Every recommendation is a verb (Create / Kill / Rebalance / Test) — not an observation ("this seems low")
- [ ] Review date is set (~4 weeks from today)

## Chain Position
Previous: `content-create` | Next: Monthly review (re-run this skill)
**Re-run triggers:** Monthly review cycle (set review date ~4 weeks from creation), after experiments conclude, when KPIs or initiatives change.

### Cross-Track Prerequisites
This skill maps content → initiatives → KPIs. For full-stack attribution:
1. **Strategy stack first** (optional): Run `problem-analysis` → `solution-design` → `funnel-planner` to generate `.agents/solution-design.md` (initiatives) and `.agents/targets.md` (KPIs).
2. **Comms stack**: Run `icp-research` → `imc-plan` → `content-create` to generate content artifacts.
3. **Then attribution**: Maps content to initiatives to KPIs with gap analysis.

Without strategy artifacts, this skill interviews for KPIs and initiatives directly — it still works, but cross-stack alignment is stronger with upstream artifacts.

---

## Before Starting

### Step 0: Product Context
Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If available, read for product context. If missing, strongly recommend running `icp-research` first — attribution mapping is significantly more accurate with product context.
If `.agents/targets.md`, `.agents/solution-design.md`, or `.agents/mkt/imc-plan.md` `date` fields are older than 30 days, recommend re-running upstream skills — stale data produces inaccurate attribution maps.

### Required Artifacts
None — can build from scratch by interviewing.

### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `targets.md` | funnel-planner | KPI baselines |
| `solution-design.md` | solution-design (from hungv47/strategy-skills) | Initiative list to map |
| `imc-plan.md` | imc-plan | Content plan to audit |
| Previous `attribution.md` | attribution | Check progress on prior action items |
| `experiment-*.md` | experiment (from strategy-skills) | Experiment outcomes as confidence adjustments — concluded experiments update contribution confidence |

Read upstream files if they exist: `.agents/targets.md`, `.agents/solution-design.md`, `.agents/mkt/imc-plan.md`. If previous `.agents/mkt/attribution.md` exists, read it — check progress on prior action items before building the new map.

### Interview
If no upstream files exist, interview for:
1. "What's your North Star metric?"
2. "What are your 3-5 primary KPIs?"
3. "What initiatives are you running or planning?"
4. "What content are you producing?"

---

## Step 1: KPI Hierarchy

**Source of truth:** `funnel-planner` SETS targets (baselines + goals); `attribution` MAPS content and initiatives to those targets. If `funnel-planner` has been run, use its targets as the KPI hierarchy — don't re-interview for KPIs that already exist in `.agents/targets.md`.

```
North Star: [metric] — [current] → [target]
├── KPI 1: [metric] — [current] → [target] — Owner: [person]
├── KPI 2: [metric] — [current] → [target] — Owner: [person]
└── KPI 3: [metric] — [current] → [target] — Owner: [person]
```

---

## Step 2: Map Initiatives → KPIs

| Initiative | Primary KPI | Contribution | Confidence |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| [Name] | [KPI] | ~X% of target | H/M/L |

**Unknown contributions:** Mark "Unknown" and add action item: "Run `experiment` to measure actual impact."

### Experiment Outcome Integration
If `.agents/experiment-*.md` files exist with concluded results:
- **Success** → Upgrade Confidence to H for that initiative's contribution
- **Iterate** → Keep Confidence at M, note iteration in progress
- **Kill** → Remove initiative from map, note reason in Orphan Initiatives

### Flag Orphans

| Orphan Initiative | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| [Name] | **Kill** — no KPI connection / **Reframe** — target [KPI] / **Test** — run experiment |

---

## Step 3: Map Content → Initiatives

| Content | Initiative | Type | Channel |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|
| [Piece] | [Initiative] | Reach / Trust / Conversion | [Channel] |

### Flag Orphan Content

| Orphan Content | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| [Piece] | **Assign** to [initiative] / **Repurpose** for [initiative] / **Sunset** |

---

## Step 4: Gap Analysis → Action Items

This is the core deliverable. Every gap produces a specific action.

| Gap | Action | Owner | Deadline |
|-----|--------|-------|----------|
| [KPI X uncovered] | **Create:** Run `solution-design` targeting this KPI | [Who] | [When] |
| [Initiative Y orphaned] | **Kill:** Archive, remove from roster | [Who] | Now |
| [Content Z unassigned] | **Rebalance:** Redirect to support [initiative] | [Who] | [When] |
| [Contribution unknown] | **Test:** Design experiment via `experiment` | [Who] | [When] |
| [Stage imbalanced] | **Rebalance:** Shift X% effort from [over] to [under] | [Who] | [When] |

---

## Re-Run Protocol

Review and refresh attribution maps on a regular cadence:

1. **Monthly review cycle:** Set review date ~4 weeks from creation
2. **On re-run:**
   - Read previous `.agents/mkt/attribution.md`
   - Check status of each prior action item (Done / In Progress / Blocked / Dropped)
   - Rename previous file to `attribution.v[N].md`
   - Rebuild map with current state
   - Compare: Did action items move the needle? Which KPIs improved?
3. **Escalation:** If same gaps persist across 2+ reviews, escalate from "Rebalance" to "Kill" or "Create"

## Initiative → KPI Mapping

| Initiative | KPI | Contribution | Confidence |
|------------|-----|-------------|------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Orphan Initiatives

## Action Items

| # | Gap | Action | Owner | Deadline |
|---|-----|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Previous Review Progress

| # | Prior Action | Status | Outcome |
|---|-------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | [action from last review] | Done / In Progress / Parked / Dropped | [Result if Done: what metric moved? If not done: blocker or reason] |

Status definitions:
- **Done** — shipped AND outcome measured. If no outcome data, it's In Progress.
- **In Progress** — started but not complete. Note blocker if any.
- **Parked** — deprioritized deliberately. Note what changed.
- **Dropped** — decided not to pursue. Note explicit reason.

If the same action appears as "Parked" or "Dropped" across 2+ reviews, escalate: either commit to doing it or kill the underlying initiative.

> On re-run: rename existing artifact to `attribution.v[N].md` and create new with incremented version.

# Attribution Map

**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Skill:** attribution
**Review date:** 2026-04-10

## KPI Hierarchy

​```
North Star: Weekly Signups — 200 → 350
├── KPI 1: Paid signup rate — 1.2% → 3.0% — Owner: Sarah
├── KPI 2: Homepage bounce rate — 52% → 40% — Owner: James
└── KPI 3: Organic signups — 80/wk → 120/wk — Owner: (unassigned)
​```

## Initiative → KPI Mapping

| Initiative | KPI | Contribution | Confidence |
|------------|-----|-------------|------------|
| Restore Paid Targeting | Paid signup rate | ~55% of total gap | H |
| Restore Social Proof | Homepage bounce | ~35% of total gap | M |

### Orphan Initiatives
None — both initiatives map to KPIs.

## Content → Initiative Mapping

| Content | Initiative | Type | Channel |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|
| Status Update Carousel | (none — brand awareness) | Reach | LinkedIn |

### Orphan Content
| Content | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Status Update Carousel | **Rebalance:** Add CTA linking to product page, reframe as supporting Paid Targeting initiative |

## Action Items

| # | Gap | Action | Owner | Deadline |
|---|-----|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | KPI 3 (organic) uncovered | **Create:** Run `problem-analysis` on organic traffic stagnation | James | 2026-03-20 |
| 2 | KPI 3 has no owner | **Assign:** Name an owner for organic signups KPI | Marketing lead | 2026-03-14 |
| 3 | Carousel content orphaned | **Rebalance:** Add product CTA to carousel, track as Paid Targeting support | Content lead | 2026-03-17 |

## Anti-Patterns

**Vanity metrics as KPIs** — Tracking impressions or followers as primary KPIs. These metrics feel good but don't connect to business outcomes. KPIs must be metrics that, if improved, move the North Star.

**Mapping everything to revenue** — Forcing every content piece to show direct revenue impact ignores the awareness and trust stages of the funnel. Map content to its appropriate funnel stage metric, not just revenue.

**Ignoring time lag** — Expecting attribution results within days for strategies that take weeks or months to show impact. Set appropriate measurement windows — brand content may take 8-12 weeks to influence pipeline.

**Orphan content without initiative links** — Content that exists because "we should post something" rather than supporting a specific initiative. Every piece should trace to an initiative and KPI — orphan content is wasted effort.

**Static attribution maps** — Building the map once and never updating it. Attribution maps decay as initiatives ship, KPIs shift, and new content is produced. Set a review cadence (monthly minimum).

**Attribution without tracking infrastructure** — Mapping content to KPIs on paper while having no event tracking, UTM parameters, or analytics in place. The map becomes theoretical without implementation. See [references/tracking-guide.md](references/tracking-guide.md) for minimum viable tracking.

**Wrong attribution model for the business** — Using last-touch attribution for a B2B product with 90-day sales cycles attributes everything to the final touchpoint and misses the content that created awareness. Match model to buying cycle length. See [references/attribution-models.md](references/attribution-models.md).

**Metrics without owners** — Every KPI and initiative must have a named person (not "the team"). Unowned metrics don't get improved — they get reported on and shrugged at.
