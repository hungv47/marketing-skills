# Communication Skills

Marketing communication: audience research → campaign planning → content creation → attribution.

## Pipeline
icp-research → imc-plan → content-create → attribution
Horizontal: lp-optimization, seo, humanize, copywriting

## Recommended Starting Point
Run `icp-research` first — it creates `.agents/product-context.md`, the canonical cross-stack artifact consumed by 12+ downstream skills across comms, strategy, prod, and design stacks.

## Artifacts
Skills write to `.agents/mkt/`, except `product-context.md` which is cross-stack:
- `.agents/product-context.md` (cross-stack — shared with strategy, prod, and design skills)
- `.agents/mkt/icp-research.md`
- `.agents/mkt/imc-plan.md`
- `.agents/mkt/content/[slug].md`
- `.agents/mkt/content/[slug].copy.md`
- `.agents/mkt/attribution.md`
- `.agents/mkt/seo-[mode].md` (mode = audit | ai | programmatic | competitor)
- `.agents/mkt/content/[slug].humanized.md`

## Cross-Stack (Optional)
Attribution and IMC Plan can read strategy artifacts for alignment:
- `.agents/solution-design.md` (from solution-design)
- `.agents/targets.md` (from funnel-planner)

## Multi-Agent Skills

Some skills use a two-layer multi-agent orchestration pattern:

- `SKILL.md` = **orchestrator** — dispatch graph, routing logic, merge step, critic gate
- `agents/` = **sub-agent instruction files** — each with role, input/output contracts, domain knowledge, self-check
- `references/` = **shared data catalogs** — formula lists, template libraries read by multiple agents

### How it works
1. Orchestrator gathers context (pre-writing, artifacts, brief)
2. **Layer 1** agents run in parallel — each writes one section independently
3. Orchestrator merges outputs into the artifact template
4. **Layer 2** agents run sequentially — each refines the full document through one lens
5. **Critic agent** scores the output and returns PASS or FAIL (max 2 rewrite cycles)

### Skills using this pattern
- `icp-research` — 7 agents (persona, voc-collector, habitat, pain-analysis, decision-psychology, synthesis, critic). Layer 1 parallel (persona + VoC + habitat) → Layer 2 sequential (pain→psychology→synthesis→critic).
- `copywriting` — 9 agents (hook, body, CTA, social-proof, variant, voice, psychology, zero-risk, critic)
- `content-create` — 8 agents (format, voc-extraction, hook, body, CTA, platform-compliance, ab-variant, critic). Layer 1→1.5→2 pattern (format resolves first, then writers parallel).
- `imc-plan` — 6 agents (pillar, angle, channel, timeline, launch-sequencing, critic). Primarily sequential — pillar→angle→channel→timeline→launch→critic.
- `humanize` — 6 agents (pattern-scanner, voice-extractor, strip, soul-injection, compression, critic). Layer 1 parallel (scan + extract) → Layer 2 sequential (strip→inject→compress→critic).

### Reusable template
`copywriting/agents/_template.md` defines the standard structure for agent instruction files. Use it when converting other skills to multi-agent.
