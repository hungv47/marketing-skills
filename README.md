## Skills

### `copywriting` — write persuasive copy

Headlines, hooks, CTAs, taglines, and full-page section copy with rubric scoring, annotations, and ranked alternatives.

### `lp-optimization` — improve landing page conversion

Audits hero section, CTAs, social proof, objection handling, and page flow. Produces specific copy and structure change recommendations.

**Use when:**
- Your landing page isn't converting and you need a diagnostic
- You want a prioritized list of changes ranked by expected conversion impact
- You're preparing for a paid traffic campaign and want the page ready

**Not for:** A/B testing variants (use `experiment`) or full site SEO audits (use `seo`)

### `attribution` — measure what's working

Maps marketing activities to business outcomes, evaluates channel ROI, identifies gaps in measurement, and recommends where to double down or cut spend.

**Use when:**
- You're spending on marketing and need to know what's actually driving results
- You want a KPI-to-initiative-to-content mapping for accountability
- You need to identify measurement gaps before scaling spend

**Not for:** setting new KPIs (use `funnel-planner`) or creating new content (use `content-create`)

**Produces:** `.agents/mkt/attribution.md`

---

### `humanize` — make AI text read human

Strips AI patterns, injects brand voice, and compresses existing text. Targets 15%+ word reduction with zero idea loss.

**Use when:**

- You need to compress text for density without losing meaning

**Not for:** writing new content from scratch (use `content-create`) or crafting new copy (use `copywriting`)

**Produces:** `.agents/mkt/content/[slug].humanized.md`
